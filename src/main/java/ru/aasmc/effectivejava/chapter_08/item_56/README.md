# Write doc comments for all exposed API elements

To document your API properly, you must precede every exported class, interface, constructor, method and field declaration with a doc comment. 

The doc comment for a method should describe succinctly the contract between the method and its client.

Doc comments should be readable both in the source code and in the generated documentation. 

Generics, enums and annotations require special care in doc comments. When documenting a generic type or method, be sure to document all type parameters in generics, constants in enums and any members in annotations.
